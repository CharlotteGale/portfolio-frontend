          When I set out to build my portfolio, I knew from the start that I wanted to create a full-stack application. 
          Having been learning C#, I saw this as the perfect opportunity to bring my knowledge together by doing something I truly enjoyâ€”building APIs.

          To give my portfolio a functional backend, I developed a small API to handle the contact form (found under the 'Contact' section). 
          This allowed me to integrate ASP.NET for backend logic, ensuring a seamless communication channel between visitors and myself.
